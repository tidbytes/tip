# TIP

A barebone compiler for the academic static analysis playground language TIP.

## Purpose

The tip project's current milestone is:

* Split TIP source code into tokens using a lexer.
* Parse the tokens into an abstract syntax tree.

Future desired features include:

* Actual static analysis on the abstract syntax tree.

## License

Let's say GPLv3. Why not?
